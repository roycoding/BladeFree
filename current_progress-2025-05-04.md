# BladeFree - Progress Summary (2025-05-04)

## Project Goal

Create a web browser-based game called "BladeFree," inspired by SkiFree's freestyle mode, featuring an aggressive inline skater. The game is a down-scrolling endless runner where the player avoids obstacles, performs tricks (jumps, grinds), and collects items for points.

## Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Phaser 3 (v3.80.1 via CDN)
*   **Language:** JavaScript (ES6 Classes)
*   **Hosting:** Static files (HTML, JS, assets) served via a simple local server (Python's `http.server`) during development.
*   **Persistence:** Browser `localStorage` for high scores.

## Completed Phases (Based on PLAN.md)

*   **Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Mechanics:**
    *   HTML/JS/Phaser setup complete.
    *   `GameplayScene` created.
    *   Player sprite added with physics (Arcade).
    *   Basic left/right keyboard movement implemented.
    *   Player constrained to screen bounds.
    *   Basic concept of downward scrolling established (player Y fixed, world scrolls up).
*   **Phase 2: Obstacles & Collision:**
    *   Placeholder obstacles (red squares) created and spawning periodically.
    *   Obstacles scroll down the screen.
    *   Off-screen obstacles are cleaned up.
    *   Collision detection between player and obstacles implemented.
    *   Basic collision handling triggers game over sequence (scene transition).
*   **Phase 3: Scoring & UI:**
    *   Score increases based on time survived.
    *   High score loaded from and saved to `localStorage`.
    *   Score and high score displayed on screen.
*   **Phase 4: Tricks, Collectibles & Game States (Partial):**
    *   **Game State Management:** Implemented `StartScene`, `GameplayScene`, and `GameOverScene` with transitions between them (Start -> Gameplay -> GameOver -> Gameplay).
    *   **Ramps & Jumps:** Placeholder ramps (blue rectangles) spawn. Overlapping triggers points, a jump sound, and applies vertical velocity for a basic jump. Landing logic returns the player to the ground and plays a sound. Ramps are marked 'hit' to prevent multiple scores.
    *   **Rails/Ledges & Grinding:** Placeholder rails (vertical grey rectangles) spawn. Overlapping snaps the player near the bottom of the rail, plays a sound, sets a grinding state, and awards points based on duration. Ending the overlap triggers an end grind state and sound.
    *   **Collectibles:** Placeholder collectibles (yellow circles) spawn. Overlapping awards points, plays a sound, and destroys the collectible.
*   **Phase 5: Audio & Polish (Partial):**
    *   **Sound Integration:** Background music and sound effects for UI confirmation, jump, land, grind start, grind end, collect, collision, and game over are loaded and played at appropriate times.
    *   **Point Pop-ups:** Text displaying points earned pops up and fades out for ramp jumps and collectibles.
    *   **Mobile Controls:** Basic touch input (tap left/right half) implemented for player movement.
    *   **Graphics & Animation (Started):** Player placeholder replaced with a sprite sheet (`assets/graphics/skater.png`, 32x48 frames). Animations defined in `GameplayScene.create` for `skate-cycle`, `jump-airborne`, `jump-landing`, `grind`, and `fall`.

## Current Issue: Player Animation State Problems

Despite implementing the player sprite sheet and defining animations, there are persistent issues with displaying the correct animation frame during specific states:

1.  **Jump Airborne Animation:** When the player hits a ramp and the `isJumping` state becomes true, the player sprite often disappears completely instead of displaying the intended airborne frame (frame 5). Console logs confirm that the code logic correctly identifies the `isJumping` state and attempts to play the `jump-airborne` animation.
2.  **Grind Animation:** When the player overlaps a rail and the `isGrinding` state becomes true, the player sprite displays the wrong frame (visually appears to be frame 5, the airborne pose) instead of the intended grind pose (frame 8). Console logs confirm the `isGrinding` state is active and the code attempts to play the `grind` animation.

**Working Animations:**

*   The default `skate-cycle` animation (frames 0-3) plays correctly when the player is on the ground.
*   The `fall` animation (frames 7, 10, 11) plays correctly when the player collides with an obstacle.
*   The `jump-landing` animation (frame 6) seems to play briefly upon landing.

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken (Without Success):**

*   Verified sprite sheet layout and frame indexing (zero-based).
*   Confirmed correct frames exist visually in the PNG.
*   Adjusted animation frame rates.
*   Tried defining single-frame animations using both `{ key: 'skater', frame: N }` and `generateFrameNumbers({ start: N, end: N })`.
*   Used `player.setFrame(N)` directly instead of `player.play('anim_key')` - this also failed to show the correct frame visually, even though logs indicated the correct frame index was being requested.
*   Added explicit `player.anims.stop()` before `play()` calls.
*   Removed explicit `stop()` calls.
*   Ensured state flags (`isJumping`, `isGrinding`) are mutually exclusive when set.
*   Adjusted the priority order of animation checks in the `update` loop.
*   Ensured the `jump-landing` animation has `repeat: 0`.

The core problem seems to be that even when the state logic correctly identifies the jump or grind state and attempts to play the corresponding single-frame animation (or set the corresponding frame directly), the visual result is incorrect (invisible or wrong frame). The multi-frame animations (`skate-cycle`, `fall`) work as expected.

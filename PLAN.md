    - [x] Define a constant scroll speed for obstacles/world elements.

## Phase 2: Obstacles & Collision

- [x] **Obstacle Creation:**
    - [x] `preload`: Load placeholder obstacle assets (e.g., cone, rock). *(Replaced with sprite frames)*
    - [x] `create`: Create a Phaser Group for obstacles (`this.obstacles`).

    - [x] `GameplayScene`: Define a list of all inventory items (e.g., using frame indices from `collectibleData`). *(Excludes helmet)*
    - [x] `GameplayScene`: Add a data structure to track collected inventory items (e.g., `this.playerInventory = {}`).
    - [x] `GameplayScene.create`:
        - [x] Create UI elements (sprites) at the top of the screen to represent each inventory item.
        - [x] Initially, display these UI item sprites as grayed out or lightened (e.g., `setTint(0xaaaaaa)`).
        - [x] Store references to these UI item sprites.
    - [x] `GameplayScene.handleCollect`:
        - [x] When a collectible that is part of the inventory set is collected:
            - [x] Mark the item as collected in `this.playerInventory`.
            - [x] Update the corresponding UI item sprite to its normal appearance (remove tint).
            - [x] Check if all inventory items have been collected.
    - [x] `GameplayScene.update` or `handleCollect`:
        - [x] If all inventory items are collected:
            - [x] Award a significant bonus (e.g., 500 points).
            - [x] Display "COLLECTION COMPLETE!" message.
            - [x] Potentially reset the inventory (or make it a one-time bonus per game). *(Implemented as repeatable)*
    - [x] `GameplayScene.create` (on restart): Reset `this.playerInventory` and UI item appearances.
    - [x] Ensure helmet is handled separately if it's not part of this specific inventory collection goal, or decide if it is. *(Helmet is separate)*

        - [ ] `GameplayScene.update`: Manage `canJump` state (set to true on landing, false on jump/leaving ground).
    - [ ] **Jumping Action:**
        - [ ] `GameplayScene.update` or new `handleJumpInput()`:
            - [ ] If jump input detected and `canJump` is true:
                - [ ] Apply upward velocity (`JUMP_VELOCITY`).

            - [ ] Consider a small "hop" animation if jumping onto a rail.
        - [ ] `GameplayScene.update`: Allow player to jump *off* a rail (ends grind, sets `isJumping`).
    - [ ] **Interaction with Obstacles:**
        - [ ] Player can jump *over* some obstacles if their jump height and timing are correct.
        - [ ] This might require adjusting obstacle hitboxes or player's hitbox while airborne.

## Phase 6: Testing & Balancing

- [ ] **Playtesting:**

    - [ ] Identify and fix bugs.
    - [ ] Optimize performance if needed.
- [ ] **Difficulty Scaling:**
    - [x] `GameplayScene`: Add `timeSurvived` counter. *(Fulfilled by `sceneRunningTime`)*
    - [x] `GameplayScene`: `update`: Increment `timeSurvived`. *(Fulfilled by `sceneRunningTime += delta`)*

        - [ ] Define how quickly the speed increases (e.g., per second or per score milestone).
    - [ ] Consider other difficulty scaling factors (e.g., obstacle density, spawn patterns). *(Spawn rate increase by score is implemented)*

## Phase 7: Deployment & Optimization

- [ ] **Asset Optimization:**
    - [ ] Review all image assets (`.png`) and optimize their file sizes (e.g., using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim) without significant quality loss.
    - [ ] Review all audio assets (`.mp3`) and ensure they are compressed appropriately (e.g., adjust bitrate if necessary).
    - [ ] Consider using more efficient image formats if appropriate (e.g., WebP, though browser compatibility needs checking for older devices).
- [ ] **Code Optimization:**
    - [ ] Minify `game.js` for production deployment to reduce its file size.
    - [ ] Review code for any performance bottlenecks or unnecessary computations, especially in the `update` loops.
- [ ] **Self-Host JavaScript Libraries:**
    - [ ] Download the Phaser 3 library (`phaser.min.js`).
    - [ ] Store it locally within the project (e.g., in an `lib/` or `js/` directory).
    - [ ] Update `index.html` to load Phaser from the local path instead of the CDN.
- [ ] **General Lightweighting:**
    - [ ] Ensure no unused assets are being loaded.
    - [ ] Check for and remove any console logs or debug features not needed for production.
    - [ ] Test loading times on various connections and devices.

# BladeFree - Release Notes

## Version 1.0.1 (Current)

**Release Date:** 2025-05-11

This release includes a fix for the layout of graphics in the initial gameplay instructions.

### Bug Fixes:
*   **Instruction Display:** Corrected the positioning of ramp and rail icons in the initial instruction overlay to prevent visual overlap.

## Version 1.0.0 (ðŸŽ‰ Official Release! ðŸŽ‰)

**Release Date:** 2025-05-11

BladeFree 1.0.0 is here! This version brings further difficulty enhancements and improved player instructions.

### New Features & Enhancements:
*   **Difficulty Scaling:**
    *   Added a third tier of horizontal obstacle speed, activating after 3 minutes of gameplay, making the late game more challenging.
*   **Gameplay Instructions:**
    *   The initial instruction overlay in the `GameplayScene` has been significantly enhanced. It now displays graphical icons for obstacles, collectibles, ramps, and rails alongside the text instructions, providing clearer guidance to new players. Layout and spacing have been improved for readability.
*   **Timer Accuracy:**
    *   Ensured the timer affecting obstacle speed-up difficulty now correctly uses `sceneRunningTime`, synchronizing it with the on-screen game timer and ensuring it resets accurately with each new game.
*   **Color Standardization:**
    *   Standardized the green color used for various pop-up messages (collectibles, tricks, grind points display) to `#18ec21` for visual consistency.
*   **Message Durations:**
    *   Increased the on-screen duration for important messages: "SKULL PROTECTION!", "You cracked your HELMET...", and transfer combo pop-ups.

## Version 0.2.8

**Release Date:** 2025-05-10

This release significantly enhances the new high score celebration animation and includes minor UI adjustments.

### Enhancements:
*   **Enhanced New High Score Celebration:**
    *   The animated sprite (previously just a dog/skate) now cycles through all collectible and obstacle items (frames 23-36).
    *   Each item performs a "spin, grow, then spin, shrink" animation sequence.
    *   The medal sprite's pulsing animation has been made more pronounced.
*   **UI Adjustment:**
    *   The `royskates.com` logo overlay in the Start, Gameplay, and "Later Blader" screens has been repositioned slightly for better visibility, especially on mobile devices.

## Version 0.2.7

**Release Date:** 2025-05-10

This release adds a visual celebration for achieving a new high score.

### Enhancements:
*   **New High Score Celebration:**
    *   When a new high score is achieved, the `GameOverScene` now displays a "NEW HIGH SCORE!" message.
    *   A spinning dog sprite (frame 34) appears on the left, centered above the "RESTART" button.
    *   A pulsing medal sprite (frame 15) appears on the right, centered above the "QUIT" button.
    *   Positions of these elements have been adjusted for better layout.

## Version 0.2.6

**Release Date:** 2025-05-10

This release includes visual enhancements to the Start Screen.

### Enhancements:
*   **Start Screen Visuals:**
    *   Added new skater graphics (`assets/graphics/start_skater.png`) to the left and right sides of the `StartScene`.
    *   Adjusted the vertical positioning of these skater graphics to prevent overlap with the main title.
    *   Added a pulsing (scaling) animation to the "PLAY" button on the `StartScene` for better visual feedback.

## Version 0.2.5

**Release Date:** 2025-05-10

This release updates the royskates.com overlay to be a clickable link.

### Enhancements:
*   **Clickable Overlay:** The `royskates_com.png` overlay graphic, displayed in the lower-left corner of the `StartScene` and `GameplayScene`, is now interactive and links to `https://royskates.com` when clicked.

## Version 0.2.4

**Release Date:** 2025-05-10

This release focuses on stability by reverting a recently attempted feature that introduced complexities.

### Changes:
*   **Reverted "Jump Off Rail Early" Feature:** The functionality allowing players to jump off rails early using horizontal input, along with its associated grind cooldown logic, has been reverted. This decision was made due to implementation complexities and unwanted side effects, such as issues with immediate re-grinding and unpredictable transfer behavior. The game now uses the previous, more stable grind mechanism where grinds end primarily when the player no longer overlaps the rail or reaches its end.
*   Documentation (`current_progress.md`) has been updated to reflect this reversion.

## Version 0.2.3

**Release Date:** 2025-05-09

This release includes an update to an asset dimension and incorporates all previous fixes.

### Enhancements:
*   **Asset Update:** The `assets/graphics/later_blader.png` image has been updated to 500x500 pixels. The game's quit sequence will now display this image at its new native resolution.

### (Features and fixes from v0.2.2 also included)

*   **Timer and Difficulty Reset:** Implemented a more robust reset mechanism for the in-game timer and the `gameStartTime` variable used for difficulty scaling. This ensures that both the displayed timer and the logic for obstacle movement/spawn rates correctly reflect the start of a new game session after a restart.
*   **Transfer Combos:** Added "Transfer Combo" scores and enhanced pop-up messages.
*   **Trick System & Animations:** Added "360" and "Royale Grind" tricks with respective animations and persistent grind name display.
*   **Difficulty Scaling:** Implemented time-based horizontal obstacle movement and score-based spawn rate increases.
*   **Mobile UI Enhancements:** Added on-screen prompts with arrows for mobile controls.
*   **Metadata & Planning:** Updated `index.html` with social media metadata and `PLAN.md` with deployment/optimization phase.
*   **Previous Bug Fixes (from v0.2.1 & v0.2.2):**
    *   Corrected 360 air animation frames.
    *   Addressed potential errors with grind name text display on creation and restart.
    *   Ensured game descriptions accurately reflect "aggressive inline skating".
    *   Fixed `grindPointsDisplay` reset on game restart.

## Version 0.2.2

**Release Date:** 2025-05-09

This release primarily addresses a bug with the in-game timer and obstacle spawn timing not resetting correctly upon game restart.

### Bug Fixes:
*   **Timer and Difficulty Reset:** Implemented a more robust reset mechanism for the in-game timer and the `gameStartTime` variable used for difficulty scaling. This ensures that both the displayed timer and the logic for obstacle movement/spawn rates correctly reflect the start of a new game session after a restart. This involved:
    *   Using `sceneRunningTime` accumulated via `delta` in the `update` loop for the visual timer.
    *   Ensuring `this.obstacleTimer` is completely removed and recreated on scene restart.
    *   Verifying `this.gameStartTime` is set using `this.sys.time.now` at the appropriate point in `GameplayScene.create()`.

### (Features and fixes from v0.2.1 also included)

*   **Transfer Combos:**
    *   Added "Transfer Combo" scores for transitioning between ramps and rails (Ramp-to-Ramp, Ramp-to-Rail, Rail-to-Ramp, Rail-to-Rail).
    *   Transfer combo pop-up messages now have a distinct color and stay on screen longer (1500ms).
*   **Trick System & Animations:**
    *   Added "360" trick for ramp jumps, displaying the trick name and points upon landing.
    *   Implemented a 2-frame (9 then 17) animation sequence for the 360 jump, with refined timing for clarity.
    *   Added "Royale Grind" trick when initiating a grind.
    *   "Royale Grind" name now displays persistently above the accumulating grind score during a grind.
    *   Removed the initial ephemeral pop-up for starting a grind, as the persistent display serves this purpose.
*   **Difficulty Scaling:**
    *   Obstacles start moving horizontally after 1 minute of gameplay, and faster after 2 minutes. Moving obstacles reverse direction at screen edges.
    *   Obstacle spawn rate increases (spawn delay decreases) for every 700 points scored by the player, up to a minimum spawn delay.
*   **Mobile UI Enhancements:**
    *   Added on-screen prompts for mobile controls ("Tap Here Move Left/Right") that appear at the start of gameplay on non-desktop devices.
    *   Prompts now include visual green (left) and purple (right) arrows instead of text arrows.
    *   Prompts stay on screen longer (6 seconds) or until the player first moves.
*   **Metadata & Planning:**
    *   Updated `index.html` with comprehensive Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata for social media sharing, accurately describing the game as an "aggressive inline skating" game.
    *   Updated `PLAN.md` to reflect the game as an "aggressive inline skating" game and added a new "Deployment & Optimization" phase.
*   **Previous Bug Fixes (from v0.2.1):**
    *   Ensured only frames 9 and 17 are displayed during the 360 air animation.
    *   Addressed a potential error with grind name text display by explicitly nullifying the text object reference after destruction and before recreation.
    *   Corrected game descriptions in `PLAN.md` and `index.html` from "skateboarding" to "aggressive inline skating".
    *   Fixed a potential null error on grind display text when restarting the game by ensuring `grindPointsDisplay` is properly reset.

# BladeFree - Progress Summary (2025-05-10)

## Project Goal

Create a web browser-based game called "BladeFree," inspired by SkiFree's freestyle mode, featuring an aggressive inline skater. The game is a down-scrolling endless runner where the player avoids obstacles, performs tricks (jumps, grinds), and collects items for points.

## Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Phaser 3 (v3.80.1 via CDN)
*   **Language:** JavaScript (ES6 Classes)
*   **Hosting:** Static files (HTML, JS, assets) served via a simple local server (Python's `http.server`) during development.
*   **Persistence:** Browser `localStorage` for high scores.

## Completed Phases (Based on PLAN.md)

*   **Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Mechanics:**
    *   HTML/JS/Phaser setup complete.
    *   `GameplayScene` created.
    *   Player sprite added with physics (Arcade).
    *   Basic left/right keyboard movement implemented.
    *   Player constrained to screen bounds.
    *   Basic concept of downward scrolling established (player Y fixed, world scrolls up).
*   **Phase 2: Obstacles & Collision:**
    *   Obstacles created using frames 32-36 from the `skater` spritesheet and spawning periodically.
    *   Obstacles scroll down the screen.
    *   Off-screen obstacles are cleaned up.
    *   Collision detection between player and obstacles implemented.
    *   Collision handling triggers game over sequence (scene transition).
*   **Phase 3: Scoring & UI:**
    *   Score increases based on time survived, grinding, jumps, and collectibles.
    *   High score loaded from and saved to `localStorage`.
    *   Score and high score displayed on screen.
*   **Phase 4: Tricks, Collectibles & Game States (Partial):**
    *   **Game State Management:** Implemented `StartScene`, `GameplayScene`, and `GameOverScene` with transitions between them (Start -> Gameplay -> GameOver -> Gameplay).
    *   **Ramps & Jumps:** Placeholder ramps (blue rectangles) spawn. Overlapping triggers points, a jump sound, and applies vertical velocity for a basic jump. Landing logic returns the player to the ground and plays a sound. Ramps are marked 'hit' to prevent multiple scores.
    *   **Rails/Ledges & Grinding:** Placeholder rails (vertical grey rectangles) spawn. Overlapping snaps the player near the bottom of the rail, plays a sound, sets a grinding state, and awards points based on duration. Ending the overlap triggers an end grind state and sound.
    *   **Collectibles:** Collectibles created using frames 24-31 from the `skater` spritesheet and spawning periodically. Overlapping awards points (defined per item, helmet=50), plays a sound, and destroys the collectible.
*   **Phase 5: Audio & Polish (Partial):**
    *   **Sound Integration:** Background music and sound effects for UI confirmation, jump, land, grind start, grind end, collect, collision, and game over are loaded and played at appropriate times.
    *   **Point Pop-ups:** Text displaying points earned (and item name for collectibles) pops up and fades out for ramp jumps and collectibles.
    *   **Mobile Controls:** Basic touch input (tap left/right half) implemented for player movement.
    *   **Graphics & Animation (Started):** Player placeholder replaced with a sprite sheet (`assets/graphics/skater.png`, 32x48 frames). Animations defined in `GameplayScene.create` for `skate-cycle`, `jump-airborne`, `jump-landing`, `grind`, and `fall`. Player animation state machine implemented in `update`.

## Recent Changes (2025-05-10)

*   Enhanced the new high score celebration: the animated sprite now cycles through all collectible and obstacle items, each performing a "spin, grow, then spin, shrink" sequence. The medal's pulsing animation was also made more pronounced.
*   Adjusted the positioning of the `royskates.com` logo overlay in multiple scenes for better mobile visibility.
*   Implemented a visual celebration for new high scores in `GameOverScene`, including a "NEW HIGH SCORE!" message, a spinning dog sprite, and a pulsing medal sprite, with adjusted positioning.
*   Added new skater graphics to the left and right sides of the `StartScene` and adjusted their positioning.
*   Added a pulsing animation to the "PLAY" button on the `StartScene`.
*   Made the `royskates_com.png` overlay in the `StartScene` and `GameplayScene` clickable, linking to `https://royskates.com`.
*   Added "Skate T-shirt" (frame 23) as a new collectible and inventory item.
*   Implemented "Switch Royale" grind variant with random player flipX.
*   Added mute button (sprite-based) to Start, Gameplay, and GameOver scenes.
*   Added game version and copyright info (with clickable link) to high score reset screen.
*   Updated `index.html` with `favicon.ico` link and `theme-color` meta tag.
*   Added audio credits to `README.md`.
*   Updated `PLAN.md` and `release_notes.md` for versions up to 0.2.3.
*   Made BladeFree/Royskates overlays static, adjusted timer position.
*   Improved inventory layout (two rows) and helmet icon visibility.
*   **Jump Off Rail Early (Reverted):**
    *   An attempt was made to allow players to jump off rails early using horizontal input.
    *   This involved adding a cooldown to prevent immediate re-grinding of the same rail and setting the player to an airborne state upon leaving the rail.
    *   **Issues Encountered:** The implementation led to several unwanted side effects, including the player being immediately pulled back onto the rail if moving towards it, which could trigger incorrect transfer points. Transfers between rails also became unpredictable.
    *   **Outcome:** This feature has been reverted for now due to these complexities and will be revisited later. The game currently uses the previous grind logic where grinds end primarily by the player no longer overlapping the rail or by reaching its end.

## Recent Changes (2025-05-05)

*   Replaced yellow circle collectible placeholders with frames 24-31 from `skater.png`.
*   Defined names (e.g., "New Skate Video") and point values for each collectible item (Helmet = 50 points).
*   Updated points pop-up to display the collected item's name.
*   Replaced red square obstacle placeholders with frames 32-36 from `skater.png`.
*   Fixed a `ReferenceError: assignment to undeclared variable graphics` in `GameplayScene.preload`.
*   Updated `PLAN.md` checklist to reflect completed tasks and add new items.

## Previous Animation Issues Fixed (2025-05-04)

The player animation issues have been resolved. The problem was related to incorrect frame mapping in the sprite sheet:

1. **Sprite Sheet Layout Discovery:** We found that the sprite sheet has 8 frames per row (even though only 4 are visible), meaning the frame indices work differently than initially expected.

2. **Correct Frame Mapping:**
   - Skating cycle: frames 0-3
   - Jump takeoff: frame 8
   - Jump airborne: frame 9
   - Jump landing: frame 10
   - Collision 1: frame 11
   - Grind pose: frame 16
   - Grab trick: frame 17
   - Collision 2: frame 18
   - Collision 3: frame 19
   - Collectibles: frames 24-31
   - Obstacles: frames 32-36

3. **Solution Implemented:**
   - Updated animation definitions to use the correct frame indices
   - Modified direct frame setting in the update loop to use frames 9 and 16 for jumping and grinding respectively
   - Added debug frame display to verify correct frame indices (later removed).

All animations now display correctly during gameplay, with the skater showing the appropriate pose for each state (skating, jumping, grinding, falling).

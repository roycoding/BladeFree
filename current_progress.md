# BladeFree - Progress Summary (2025-05-10)

## Project Goal

Create a web browser-based game called "BladeFree," inspired by SkiFree's freestyle mode, featuring an aggressive inline skater. The game is a down-scrolling endless runner where the player avoids obstacles, performs tricks (jumps, grinds), and collects items for points.

## Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Phaser 3 (v3.80.1 via CDN)
*   **Language:** JavaScript (ES6 Classes)
*   **Hosting:** Static files (HTML, JS, assets) served via a simple local server (Python's `http.server`) during development.
*   **Persistence:** Browser `localStorage` for high scores.

## Completed Phases (Based on PLAN.md)

*   **Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Mechanics:**
    *   HTML/JS/Phaser setup complete.
    *   `GameplayScene` created.
    *   Player sprite added with physics (Arcade).
    *   Basic left/right keyboard movement implemented.
    *   Player constrained to screen bounds.
    *   Basic concept of downward scrolling established (player Y fixed, world scrolls up).
*   **Phase 2: Obstacles & Collision:**
    *   Obstacles created using frames 32-36 from the `skater` spritesheet and spawning periodically.
    *   Obstacles scroll down the screen.
    *   Off-screen obstacles are cleaned up.
    *   Collision detection between player and obstacles implemented.
    *   Collision handling triggers game over sequence (scene transition).
*   **Phase 3: Scoring & UI:**
    *   Score increases based on time survived, grinding, jumps, and collectibles.
    *   High score loaded from and saved to `localStorage`.
    *   Score and high score displayed on screen.
*   **Phase 4: Tricks, Collectibles & Game States (Partial):**
    *   **Game State Management:** Implemented `StartScene`, `GameplayScene`, and `GameOverScene` with transitions between them (Start -> Gameplay -> GameOver -> Gameplay).
    *   **Ramps & Jumps:** Placeholder ramps (blue rectangles) spawn. Overlapping triggers points, a jump sound, and applies vertical velocity for a basic jump. Landing logic returns the player to the ground and plays a sound. Ramps are marked 'hit' to prevent multiple scores.
    *   **Rails/Ledges & Grinding:** Placeholder rails (vertical grey rectangles) spawn. Overlapping snaps the player near the bottom of the rail, plays a sound, sets a grinding state, and awards points based on duration. Ending the overlap triggers an end grind state and sound.
    *   **Collectibles:** Collectibles created using frames 24-31 from the `skater` spritesheet and spawning periodically. Overlapping awards points (defined per item, helmet=50), plays a sound, and destroys the collectible.
*   **Phase 5: Audio & Polish (Partial):**
    *   **Sound Integration:** Background music and sound effects for UI confirmation, jump, land, grind start, grind end, collect, collision, and game over are loaded and played at appropriate times.
    *   **Point Pop-ups:** Text displaying points earned (and item name for collectibles) pops up and fades out for ramp jumps and collectibles.
    *   **Mobile Controls:** Basic touch input (tap left/right half) implemented for player movement.
    *   **Graphics & Animation (Started):** Player placeholder replaced with a sprite sheet (`assets/graphics/skater.png`, 32x48 frames). Animations defined in `GameplayScene.create` for `skate-cycle`, `jump-airborne`, `jump-landing`, `grind`, and `fall`. Player animation state machine implemented in `update`.

## Recent Changes (2025-05-05)

*   Replaced yellow circle collectible placeholders with frames 24-31 from `skater.png`.
*   Defined names (e.g., "New Skate Video") and point values for each collectible item (Helmet = 50 points).
*   Updated points pop-up to display the collected item's name.
*   Replaced red square obstacle placeholders with frames 32-36 from `skater.png`.
*   Fixed a `ReferenceError: assignment to undeclared variable graphics` in `GameplayScene.preload`.
*   Updated `PLAN.md` checklist to reflect completed tasks and add new items.

## Previous Animation Issues Fixed (2025-05-04)

The player animation issues have been resolved. The problem was related to incorrect frame mapping in the sprite sheet:

1. **Sprite Sheet Layout Discovery:** We found that the sprite sheet has 8 frames per row (even though only 4 are visible), meaning the frame indices work differently than initially expected.

2. **Correct Frame Mapping:**
   - Skating cycle: frames 0-3
   - Jump takeoff: frame 8
   - Jump airborne: frame 9
   - Jump landing: frame 10
   - Collision 1: frame 11
   - Grind pose: frame 16
   - Grab trick: frame 17
   - Collision 2: frame 18
   - Collision 3: frame 19
   - Collectibles: frames 24-31
   - Obstacles: frames 32-36

3. **Solution Implemented:**
   - Updated animation definitions to use the correct frame indices
   - Modified direct frame setting in the update loop to use frames 9 and 16 for jumping and grinding respectively
   - Added debug frame display to verify correct frame indices (later removed).

All animations now display correctly during gameplay, with the skater showing the appropriate pose for each state (skating, jumping, grinding, falling).
